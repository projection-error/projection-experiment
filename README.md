Projection error can lead to rationale agents viewing the same object with contradicting observations.

For example, below is a cube containing four connected line segments- two blue and two red. Let's call it a " (Note: Created with projection-cube.py & cube.txt)

When viewed isometrically in 3D i is clear that the length of the blue lines equals the length of the red lines.

However, Observers X, Y, and Z (viewing the object along the respective axis at a far away distance) would each answer the following question differently:

Question: "Which line is longer; red or blue?"

Observer X: "Blue."
Observer Y: "Red."
Observer Z: "They are the same length."

Each of these observations represent three different kinds of wrong:

Observers X and Y have provided wrong answers.
Observer Z has provided the right answer - however, for the wrong reason.
